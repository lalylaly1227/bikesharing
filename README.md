## Overview of the analysis
What we are creating with Module 14
Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format
Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation

## Results
In Deliverable 1, weâ€™ll use Pandas to change the datatype of the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype to get the time in hours and minutes.

In Deliverable 2. Using Tableau, create visualizations that show:
How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.

## Summary
From the data that was gathered, we can see that there were more male riders and that most rides took place during weekdays during rush hour periods.  The rides were also less than 30 minutes on average.
